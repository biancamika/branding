# Branding
Hi there.

Our logo is available above.
Branding guidelines to come later on. Make sure to get in touch with us if you want to use our logo.

## Logo Usage


The Developh logo is always presented with both its icon and wordmark. 


In cases where the full logo is too long for a pubmat/collateral, only the icon is used. However, this is only allowed when the Developh name is already evident (i.e. a pubmat on our own social media page). For external media (partners/sponsors), please use the full logo. 

Whether with wordmark or without wordmark, the logo must always have a healthy amount of whitespace around it. This means that other elements (e.g. logos) must not be in proximity of it. Basically, the logo has to be able to breathe; if anything is too close to it, it will suffocate.

The logo is only allowed to be presented in shades of blue, black, and white. The background color should be high-contrast to the color it is presented in.
